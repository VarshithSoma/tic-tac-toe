# tic-tac-toe
I developed a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players who take turns clicking on a 3x3 grid to place their respective symbols, "X" and "O."
Here's an overview of how the game was created:
HTML Structure: I set up the game's user interface using HTML. The structure includes a grid of buttons with the class "btn-option" that players click to make their moves. The game's status and messages are displayed using HTML elements with appropriate class names.
CSS Styling: I applied CSS styles to make the game visually appealing. The styling includes formatting the grid, buttons, and messages to enhance the user experience.
JavaScript Logic: The game's functionality is powered by JavaScript. I created an event listener for the container that captures player clicks and enforces game rules. The logic allows players to take turns and updates the grid with their symbols.
New Game and Retry: I implemented "New Game" and "Retry" buttons to start fresh games. The "New Game" button resets the board and allows players to continue playing. The "Retry" button restarts the game without resetting the scores or the initial game state.
